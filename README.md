# CS300_TwoDimensionalSpace_Binary_Trees

I implemented a slightly more complex version of binary search
trees.The trees that I worked on in this project let us search on two-dimensional spaces,
and extensions to higher dimensional spaces should be obvious. These kind of trees
are very useful in many graphics applications and in computer aided design tools for
automated design of VLSI (very large scale integration) circuits. Instead of each node
having at most 2 children, in such trees, nodes have at most 4 children.
